# DeuBot

**Primary goal**: Explore capabilities and limitations of coding with AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) rather than build production-ready software.

*This README was written by an AI coding assistant.*

## What It Is

A German learning Telegram bot with spaced repetition. Built iteratively with Claude Code to test agent-driven development workflows. The bot itself is an AI agent (OpenAI) that uses tool calling for translation, phrase storage, and spaced repetition reviewsâ€”showing buttons in Telegram UI through tools, not hardcoded commands.

## Design

**Agent architecture**: OpenAI integration with structured tool calling. Tools have elaborate descriptions following Claude Code's documentation philosophy (see [Decoding Claude Code](https://minusx.ai/blog/decoding-claude-code/)). Agent returns typed outputs using dataclasses, not magic strings.

**Spaced repetition**: SM-2 algorithm with JSON persistence. Quality ratings (1-5) adjust ease factors and intervals for optimal review scheduling.

**Deployment**: Systemd service with Type=notify protocol for proper startup signaling. Deployed via rsync to remote host.

**Stack**: Python 3.13, `uv` for dependencies, Telegram Bot API, OpenAI GPT.

## Testing & Development

Integrated into development cycle:
- **Linting**: mypy, black (120 chars), flake8
- **LLM tests**: Validate tool usage patterns and agent behavior probabilistically (semantic correctness, not exact matches)
- **Logic tests**: SM-2 algorithm correctness
- **End-to-end tests**: Resilient to LLM non-determinism

```bash
make lint   # Run all linters
make run    # Run locally
make deploy # Deploy to remote systemd service
```

## Structure

`deubot/agent.py` - AI agent with tool calling
`deubot/tools.py` - Tool definitions with detailed documentation
`deubot/bot.py` - Telegram handler
`deubot/database.py` - SM-2 spaced repetition storage
`deubot/systemd.py` - Type=notify service integration

Configuration via `.env` file (see `.env.example`).
