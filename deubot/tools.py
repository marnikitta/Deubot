            "description": """Save one or more German phrases to the learning database for spaced repetition review.

Call this tool immediately when the user provides or asks about concrete German phrase(s), then provide your response. Do not announce your intent to save before calling the tool.

Usage Pattern:
1. Detect if concrete German phrase(s) will be produced or interpreted
2. Call save_phrases with list of German texts (even if just one phrase)
3. Add articles (der/die/das) to all nouns - this is critical for German learning
4. Then provide your response per language policy

DO NOT call for grammar questions, general explanations, or language concepts.
DO NOT call when user explicitly asks not to save.

Article Handling:
German nouns need their articles to be useful for learning. When saving:
- User sends "Gleis" → save as "das Gleis" (add the article)
- User sends "Hund" → save as "der Hund" (add the article)
- User sends "Katze" → save as "die Katze" (add the article)
- User sends "der Tisch" → save as "der Tisch" (article already present)
- Non-nouns like "Hallo", "Guten Morgen" → save as-is (no article needed)

BATCH SAVING:
Always pass phrases as an array, even for a single phrase. This tool is optimized for batch operations.

Single Phrase Examples:
- User: "How do you say umbrella?" → save_phrases(["der Regenschirm"]) then respond
- User: "What does Krankenhaus mean?" → save_phrases(["Krankenhaus"]) then explain
- User: "Guten Abend" → save_phrases(["Guten Abend"]) then translate
- User: "Translate 'the book' to German" → save_phrases(["das Buch"]) then respond

Batch Examples (Multiple Phrases):
- User: "Translate: hello, goodbye, thank you" → save_phrases(["Hallo", "Auf Wiedersehen", "Danke"]) then respond
- User: "What are Tisch, Stuhl, Lampe?" → save_phrases(["der Tisch", "der Stuhl", "die Lampe"]) then translate
- User: "Save 5 different common domestic animals" → save_phrases(["der Hund", "die Katze", "das Pferd", "der Hamster", "der Fisch"]) then list them
- User: "Give me 10 fruits in German" → save_phrases([all 10 fruit words with articles]) then provide list
- User provides list of 100 words to learn → save_phrases([all 100 phrases]) then respond

Large Batch Examples:
- Vocabulary list import: save_phrases([hundreds or thousands of phrases]) - no limit on array size
- Topic vocabulary: save_phrases([all relevant phrases for the topic])
- User: "Save common phrases for traveling" → save_phrases([20-30 travel phrases])

When NOT to Use:
- User: "What is the dative case?" → Grammar concept only (no concrete phrases)
- User: "What's the difference between der/die/das?" → Grammar explanation only
- User asks about conjugation rules → General concept only
- User: "just explain, don't save" → Respect user preference

Tool Calling Pattern:

RIGHT - Call tool immediately:
User: Notruf
Assistant: [calls save_phrases(["Notruf"])]
Assistant: <b>Emergency call</b>

Notruf refers to an emergency phone call...

WRONG - Announcing intent first:
User: Notruf
Assistant: Calling save_phrases for the German phrase and then explaining per policy...
[This creates unnecessary back-and-forth - user sees this message before the actual content]

Important Notes:
- ALWAYS pass an array, even for single phrases: ["der Hund"] not "der Hund"
- Save phrases with articles for nouns: "der Tisch" not "Tisch"
- Include context when relevant: "Guten Morgen" not just "Morgen"
- Array can contain any number of phrases: 1, 10, 100, 1000+
- Tool handles duplicates automatically (won't save the same phrase twice)

            "description": """Retrieve user's vocabulary with flexible sorting and filtering for analysis, level estimation, or sentence creation.

This is your window into the user's complete learning progress. Use it to understand what they know and tailor your responses accordingly.

Usage Pattern:
- Call this IMMEDIATELY when user wants to analyze their vocabulary
- Choose appropriate sort_by based on user's goal
- Adjust limit based on task (small for sentences, large for analysis)

When to Use:
- "Estimate my language level" → limit=2000, sort_by="mastery", ascending=False
- "What's my vocabulary like?" → limit=100, sort_by="mastery", ascending=False
- "Show me my saved phrases" → limit=100, sort_by="id", ascending=True
- "Create a sentence with my words" → limit=50, sort_by="mastery", ascending=False
- "What are my newest words?" → limit=20, sort_by="id", ascending=False
- "Which phrases do I know best?" → limit=30, sort_by="mastery", ascending=False
- "List phrases alphabetically" → limit=100, sort_by="alphabetical", ascending=True

When NOT to Use:
- User wants to start a review → use get_next_due_phrases instead
- User asks about phrases due NOW → use get_next_due_phrases instead

Sorting Strategies:

**sort_by="mastery"** (Mastery Level)
- Calculated as: ease_factor × interval_days
- ascending=False → Best known phrases first
- ascending=True → Weakest phrases first
Use for: Level estimation, creating sentences, finding words to focus on

**sort_by="alphabetical"** (A-Z by German text)
- ascending=True → A to Z
- ascending=False → Z to A
Use for: Browsing, finding specific words, organized lists

**sort_by="id"** (Addition Order)
- ascending=True → Oldest first
- ascending=False → Newest first
Use for: Seeing learning progression, finding recent additions

Limit Guidelines:
- Level estimation: 2000 (get everything)
- Vocabulary review: 100-200
- Sentence creation: 30-50 (most mastered)
- Quick check: 10-20
- Maximum allowed: 2000

Return Format:
Returns list of phrases with German text only:
"- Guten Morgen"
"- das Buch"
"- Krankenhaus"

Analysis Approach:
Count phrases, assess variety/complexity, identify CEFR level indicators (A1: Hallo, Danke; A2: einkaufen, gestern; B1: obwohl, trotzdem), assess grammar coverage, provide level estimate with evidence.
